Du kan se det endelige resultatet i bildet over, og under er et bildet av kakemassen før
den gikk i forma. Den var ikke helt konge, men smakte helt greit. Man kan nok helt fint
redusere mengden vann i glasuren ganske mye. Men aller best er det å lage en annen, for
eksempel

Hello World Cake with Chocolate sauce.

This prints hello world, while being tastier than Hello World Souffle. The main
chef makes a " world!" cake, which he puts in the baking dish. When he gets the
sous chef to make the "Hello" chocolate sauce, it gets put into the baking dish
and then the whole thing is printed when he refrigerates the sauce. When
actually cooking, I'm interpreting the chocolate sauce baking dish to be
separate from the cake one and Liquify to mean either melt or blend depending on
context.
