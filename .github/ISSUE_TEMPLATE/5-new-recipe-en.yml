        Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
        Whisk together eggs and sugar in a bowl.
        Peel and mash bananas, add them to the bowl, and mix together.
        Melt butter in a small saucepan, pour in milk, and then mix it into the bowl.
        Stir in flour, baking soda, and baking powder to a smooth and fine batter. Chop, for example, some chocolate pieces or anything else tempting and add it to the bread.
        Pour the batter into a baking tin of about 1.5 liters, and place the tin on the lower rack in the oven for about 35 minutes.
        Remove the bread from the tin and cool on a rack.
